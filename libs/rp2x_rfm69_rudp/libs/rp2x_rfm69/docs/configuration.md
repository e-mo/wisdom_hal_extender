# Notes on configuring the Rfm69

[This forum discussion saved my life](https://lowpowerlab.com/forum/rf-range-antennas-rfm69-library/changing-the-rmf69hcw-configuration-and-back/)
Low power labs also produces a set of drivers and a higher level interface for RFM69 radios in C++, but has limited Pico support and I wanted a
proper C interface. However, this forum discussion is VERY helpful (and saved my idiot life) when I was trying to actually get my radios to talk
initially.
