# rp2x_rfm69 library usage examples
  
Currently I have provided a pair of examples to set up two for communication.  
Both example directories include a Makefile that you can use to simplify the build,
or you can use CMake directly (or whatever build system you want I'm not your dad).  
I have provided these nice build files for you though, so it would be a shame not to use them.

## Usage

If you want to use the provided Makefile:
```bash
make build
# If you have picotool this will call it for you with the correct file (must have only one pico connected)
make load
```
