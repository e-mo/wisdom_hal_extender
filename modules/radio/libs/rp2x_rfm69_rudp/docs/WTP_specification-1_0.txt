The WISDOM Transmission Protocol (WTP) is a reliable transmission protocol compatible with the
RFM69 series of transponders. It is loosely based on the TCP (Transport Control Protocol) with
the primary differences being that WTP is only half-duplex and is not persistent. The connection
is established, the payload is sent, and the connection is dropped. The protocol also supports
a simplex broadcast. 

See 'Protocol Details' below for more information.

Packet Header:
 
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
  0  [    packet size     ]  [     rx address     ]  [     tx address     ]  [        flags       ]
  4  [             sequence number                ]  [            acknowledgement number          ]
  8  [--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------]
  12 [                                        data segment                                        ]

  packet size: 8 bits
    Entire size of packet (data + header) minus the packet size byte.
    max: 0xFF (255 bytes)
  
  rx address: 8 bits
    Receiving node address.
  
    address range: 0x00-0xFE 
    broadcast address: 0xFF
  
  tx address: 8 bits
    Transmitting node address.
  
    address range: 0x00-0xFE 
  
  flags: 8 bits
    Transmission control flags.
  
    0x01: SYN - Synchronize sequence numbers. Only first packet from each end should have this
                flag set. 
    0x02: ACK - Indicates that the acknowledgment number field is significant. All packets past
                first SYN packet should have this flag set. 
    0x04: FIN - Signals an end of transmission. Should be responded to with one final FIN ACK
                packet.
    0x08: RTR - Retry flag signals that this is a retransmission of a packet, meaning that either
                the original transmission failed, or the ACK was not received. 
                
  sequence number: 16 bits
    Randomly generated at beginning of transmission and incremented with each transmitted packet.
    Used to identify sequence ordering and ensure synchronized communication.

  acknowledgement number: 16 bits
    Last received sequence number + 1 to ensure communication stays synchronized.
    Only significant if ACK flag is set. 
  
  data segment: 58 bytes (AES) or 248 bytes (No AES)
    If harware AES is enabled, the data segment of a packet is limited by the size of the RFM69
    hardware buffer.
    [66 bytes (buffer size) - 8 bytes (header) = 58 bytes]

    Without AES enabled, the data segment size is limited by the 8 bit packet size.
    [255 bytes (8 bit max) + 1 byte (size byte) - 8 bytes (header) = 248 bytes]


Protocol Details:

  The WTP protocol is designed to be compatible with underlying hardware (RFM69) as well as the 
  intended use of the Wisdom equipment (remote location sensor data collection). For this reason
  the protocol is designed to afford as much reliability as possible while trying to minimize
  the number of packets required to achieve that reliability.

  WTP protocol is similar to TCP in that a three-way handshake is perfomed to synchronize
  communication for the transfer of segmented packets. However, since it is common for sensor
  data to fit easily into a single segment, the connection handshake and teardown can happen
  simultaneously. Data transmission begins with the very first packet. This means that the
  minimum number of packets sent during communication is three instead of requiring three
  packets to establish handshake, one to send data, and two more to finish teardown. This
  optimization intends to significantly reduce the inefficiency of sending many small bursts
  of data as is common in IoT applications.

  handshake:
    Similar to TCP, the handshake is used to synchronize sequence and acknowledgement numbers
    to ensure correct ordering when constructing segmented data and to ensure retransmission
    of the correct packet in the even of packet loss.

    step 1: TX: (tx sequence number) = random 16 bit unsigned integer.

            TX => SYN => RX

            Note: data segment transfer begins with first packet.

    step 2: RX: (rx sequence number) = random 16 bit unsigned integer.
                (rx acknowledgement number) = (tx sequence number) + 1.                 

            RX => SYN ACK => TX

    step 3: TX: (tx sequence number) = (rx acknowledgement number).
                (tx acknowledgement number) = (rx sequence number) + 1.

            TX => ACK => RX

  transmission:
    Once the handshake has been performed, data transmission continues if more data segments
    remain to be sent.

    send segment: TX: (tx sequence number) = (rx acknowledgement number).
                      (tx acknowledgement number) = (rx sequence number) + 1.

                  TX => ACK => RX

    acknowledge:  RX: (rx sequence number) = (tx acknowledgement number).
                      (rx acknowledgement number) = (tx sequence number) + 1.

                  RX => ACK => TX

  retransmission:
    If a packet fails to send, or the corresponding ACK packet is never received, a packet will
    be retransmitted. In this scenario, the retransmitted packet sets the RTR flag, and RX
    responds with an ACK packet with the RTR flag also set. 

    send segment: TX: (tx sequence number) = (rx acknowledgement number).
                      (tx acknowledgement number) = (rx sequence number) + 1.

                  TX => ACK RTR => RX

    acknowledge:  RX: (rx sequence number) = (tx acknowledgement number).
                      (rx acknowledgement number) = (tx sequence number) + 1.

                  RX => ACK RTR => TX

  teardown:
    The TX side sets the FIN flag with the packet containing the final data segment. This may
    be the very first packet sent, meaning the handshake and teardown may happen simultaneously.

    step 1: TX: (tx sequence number) = (rx acknowledgement number).
                (tx acknowledgement number) = (rx sequence number) + 1.

                TX => ACK FIN => RX

                Note: contains final data segment.

    step 2: RX: (rx sequence number) = (tx acknowledgement number).
                (rx acknowledgement number) = (tx sequence number) + 1.

                RX => ACK FIN => TX

    step 3: TX: (tx sequence number) = (rx acknowledgement number).
                (tx acknowledgement number) = (rx sequence number) + 1.

                TX => ACK FIN => RX

                Note: TX side ends transmission after sending.

  handshake + teardown:
    When there is only one segment of data, the handshake and teardown happen simultaneously.
    This simply requires that the TX side begins communication with the FIN flag set.

    step 1: TX: (tx sequence number) = random 16 bit unsigned integer.

            TX => SYN FIN => RX

            Note: contains only data segment.

    step 2: RX: (rx sequence number) = random 16 bit unsigned integer.
                (rx acknowledgement number) = (tx sequence number) + 1.                 

            RX => SYN ACK FIN => TX

    step 3: TX: (tx sequence number) = (rx acknowledgement number).
                (tx acknowledgement number) = (rx sequence number) + 1.

            TX => ACK FIN => RX

            Note: TX side ends transmission after sending.

  broadcast:
    Broadcast transmissions (rx address = 0xFF) are not guaranteed, do not begin a handshake,
    and thus require no response from RX. Broadcast transmissions are simplex communications.

    step 1: TX: (tx sequence number) = random 16 bit unsigned integer.

            TX => SYN => RX
    ...

    step n: TX: (tx sequence number) = (tx sequence number) + 1.

            TX => (no flags) => RX
    ...

    end:    TX: (tx sequence number) = (tx sequence number) + 1.

            TX => FIN => RX


Notes for Future Development:

I kept this protocol simple because my initial use case is simple. There are, however, 5 unused
bits in the flags field, so there is potential room for the protocol to expand in functionality
without any changes made to the packet structure. I think auto bitrate and AES negotiation could
be solid features that I will be considering after inital implementation.

I do have some feelings about a potential 2.0 version of the protocol that is compatible with
both the RFM69 and RFM95 (LoRa) transceiver, but that would require abandoning several of the
hardware specific features of the RFM69 chipset, so it isn't a decision I can make lightly. Also,
I think that Semtech are a pile of capitalistic stinkers hiding their protocol behind proprietary
licenses so I don't really want to use their tech if I can help it.
